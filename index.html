                        <p>Hello there, my name is Shreyas Lad and I'm a Junior at Dublin High School. I'm interested in low-level development, particularly that of firmware, bootloaders, and operating systems. I plan on completing a Masters degree in either Electrical Engineering or Computer Science.</p>
                        <p>I learn science by doing. When I want to learn something new, whether that be a language or a concept, I make my own projects. When I first started out programming in Python in elementary school, I created simple graphical games using the tkinter and pygame libraries. From there I moved onto HTML/CSS and NodeJS, then Java, x86 assembly, and finally C. When starting out, I search up basic syntax and then immediately pick a project, learning new things along the way. When I decided to learn C about a year ago, I decided to jump straight into the deep end and write an operating system. I was fortunate enough to find a few scattered tutorials here and there and eventually ended up with a basic, yet working, operating system: Flame. I then went on to revise the code over and over again, phasing out old tutorial code and mistakes I made when starting out, as well as adding support for newer hardware. It is this effort over the past year, constantly searching problems, reading documentation, and participating in forums/IRC that allowed me to learn. This ability to teach oneself, is in my eyes, the most important quality one can possess. One can learn so much by observing and practicing, a philosophy that takes time, but rewards. </p>

                            <p>The Compound Machine Project was a real-world engineering assignment in my Principles of Engineering course in which we were tasked with building a complicated machine to perform some task. The machine had to be composed of several different simple machines (machines such as levers, inclined planes, wheels and axles, and others) and made of common household items. My team decided to create a paper stamping machine which aimed to automate the process of stamping hundreds and thousands of documents per day in order to certify them. The final machine used inclined planes, levers, wheels and axles, pulleys, and screws in order to create a mechanism to stamp such documents. The final model for the machine can be seen below, along with final dimensions and materials.</p>

                            <p>The Bridge Design project was a particularly interesting challenge in my Principles of Engineering course. It required us to virtually construct a bridge that costs the least possible amount of money and maintains its structural integrity when subject to changing loads. In the simlation, a truck would pass over the bridge that my team and I designed, therefore testing whether it would be able to withstand such loads for the price. This taught us not only how to make compromises when engineering -- making sure to use the right materials to get the job done well while also keeping the cost low -- but it also taught us how to work together and manage our workloads in order to come up with a final design that not only maintained its integrity and was incredibly cheap, but was also practical and aesthetically pleasing.</p>

                            <p>Sonar is a Type-1 Hypervisor aimed to implement kernel hotswapping. It paravirtualizes guest operating systems and swaps them out when they wish to do so. The guest kernel saves its internal state and communicates the new version to the hypervisor, at which point the hypervisor takes control of the machine, saves the guest machine state, and loads the new kernel. The new kernel then loads the previously saved state and picks up where the old kernel left off, seamlessly transitioning the user to the new kernel.</p>

Limine is the implementation of stivale: a modern boot protocol designed to easily load 64 bit kernels in the higher half, providing them with all the information they need to bootstrap the rest of the system. Limine has support for the ext2, ext4, fat32, and echfs filesystems and can load ELF files with support for KASLR.</p>

                            <p>During my time at high school, I've had the incredibly opportunity to be a part of Youth Coding Workshops. I was leargely thrust into a position of leadership, and so I was forced to adapt. I lead a team of 12 people right out of the gate to plan out the logistics, execution, and implementation of competitions to further challenge our students. In addition to that, I also became responsible for envisioning and executing a path that I wanted to take YCW in, along with meeting other education officials to reach out to middle schoolers across the Tri-Valley Area. It was through this constant struggle that learned how to plan out a large project, divide work into small sections to get everything done by the deadline, and how to coordinate and work with other people to constantly revise, update, and implement the tasks we defined.</p>
