              <p>&emsp;Recently, I have gotten into low level development with languages such as C and Rust. This was a big change from what I was previously doing, a combination of Java, NodeJS, and HTML. I was no longer confined in the protective bubble of the JVM or the browser, a place where once mistake could easily be patched without much debugging work required. That all changed when I stepped into the world of C. C has no boundaries. You have full access to allocate however much memory you want, keep track of garbage control, and interact with the fundamental building blocks of the operating system that you wouldn't normally be able to work with. However, with low level languages, there are only two real places you can go: embedded systems or security research. There are very limited applications of what you can do with this language outside the operating system, with the exception of Rust. This poses a real problem, however, security research seems to pay well and requires good problem solving skills. You can show the world what you've done, and maybe even participate in bug bounty programs. You can be the person to rip apart the Operating System and disagnose core flaws. That is pretty cool.</p>

              <p>&emsp; I have been working with C for some time now, almost a year to be exact. When it comes to programming, I always learn by doing. I find a topic that's interesting to me and I just look up examples. When I start a new language, I first just browse some open source programs to get a feel for the syntax, and then I make a project. Although learning this way takes longer, I feel that I end up with a language that I know how to use in different situations, a jack of all trades, if you will. I first started out with Python 2.7 when I was around 8 years old. I didn't know what to do at the time, but I figured out how to make basic for loops and optimize them to run faster. Then, I got into HTML, CSS, and NodeJS. I made a couple libraries with my friend, such as CustomMarkup and CopyThat, which for some reason still get downloads on NPM after 5 years of being released. I then moved to Bash scripting, taking control of the Unix terminal and learning different commands just by searching them up on StackOverflow or reading the man pages. One script I wrote made it easier to push to git remotes while the other tried to incorporate Artificial Intelligence into the terminal. Next I moved to Java, where I made a basic Skyblock plugin for a server owner, working nearly the entire summer whenever I had free time. I also wrote a basic git based IDE with Swing and a grade and attendance tracker for the terminal, solely in Java.</p> 
              
              <p>&emsp;I initially wanted to start writing in C for pure enjoyment. I saw a lot of people using it and I thought it might be useful oneday. So I set off and thought to myself "What is the most absurd project that I can make which will instantly teach me C?" The answer? An operating system. Just figuring out how to even start with the project took well over 6 months. In our everyday lives, we do not normally think about how our computer works, just that it does something obscure to fulfill the end user experience. Not many people write tutorials to write one by yourself, mainly because it is tedious, requires a lot of debugging and analysis, and the demand for it is quite low, very, very low. Not many people want to build an operating system. Why build one when you already have one that works perfectly fine? I was able to find two tutorials, one on GitHub by <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial" class="link-black">@cfenollosa</a> and found supplemental resources on the <a href="wiki.osdev.org" class="link-black">OSDev Wiki</a>. Of the massive amount of searching I did, these were the <em>only two resources</em>. It has been roughly over a year since I started work on it, and there is still a lot more left to do, things that I'm not quite sure of how to implement yet, but I guess that is the fun of it.</p>

              <p>&emsp;I have learned a lot of things over these past 7 years of programming. I got bored with one thing, and then went to another. From that I went somewhere else, and then somewhere else. I do not really know what I want to do, but I have a pretty good idea. With all these different technologies, I have been able to quickly adapt and transfer some of the skills I learned from my previous project into my current ones. That is the beauty of programming. I guess programming is all about adapting to different technologies, since different languages and frameworks will be better suited for the problem you are trying to solve than the ones you already know. It is good to step out of your comfort zone a bit, and play around with everything else out there. There is a whole community willing to help with any problem known to mankind, so use it.</p>

                <p>Skyblock is a simple spigot skyblock plugin. It allows players to create a new island that is automatically generated a random distance away from the last generated island. The player spawns in with a couple of items and a hologram with their name. Other players are not allowed to edit other people's islands and have separate inventories from other worlds. Players can access a GUI menu in which they can visit their own island or anyone else's.</p>
